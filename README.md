# ResistorReader
to identify resitor codes frrom pictures of resistors
--Warning-----------------------------------------------
Still not fully working. Output needs to be better organized. 
Also needs a better color classifier eventually to handle 
more intolerant lighting conditions.

##USAGE
DEV and DEBUG, -d

## Vision

The eventual goal is to able to take a picture of an arbitrary   
PCB and get a list of identifiable parts and their   
locations on the board. Should also work for individual components.  
The goal is to make it a generic EE component identifier.
